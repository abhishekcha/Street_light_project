# street_light_project
# descreption
I developed this project using java weka ms-excel also we use navies bayes algorithms.
firstly you need to download any java ide for developing project
then you need to download weka for data visuailization 
then learn about navie bayes algorithms.

# Pre-requisites
code editor->eclipse
algorithms->navie bayes algorithms.
data visualization tool->weka
# Reason
the huge amount of electrical power of many countries is consumed in lighting the street.we purpose a system that automaticall switche off the light.logically we are trying to show how save large amount of power.
# Challenges I faced Making this Project
While uploading the data  there is one issue data in the of CSV(comma seprated file) in that time eclipse was unable to support csv file then we convert csv to arff after that it working fine.
# Future Scope
As we know that traffic and wheather are realated to eachother , if wheather is clean then traffic will be smooth.
it detects how to save energy if wheather is sunny it charge the light and if wheather is cloudy then its automatically off the light.
